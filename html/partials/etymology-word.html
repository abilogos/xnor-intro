    The term "XNOR" is a portmanteau of two fundamental logical operators in Boolean algebra: "X" and "NOR." To understand the etymology of "XNOR," it's essential to break down these components and explore their origins:
<br>
<ul>
    <li>
        "X" in XNOR: <br>
The "X" in "XNOR" stands for "exclusive." In Boolean algebra, the "exclusive" operation (often denoted as XOR) refers to the logical XOR gate, which outputs true (1) if the number of true inputs is odd. In other words, it returns true if the inputs are not equal. The "exclusive" aspect of this operation relates to its behavior of being true exclusively when the inputs differ.
    </li>
    <li>
        "NOR" in XNOR: <br>
"NOR" is a standard logical operator in Boolean algebra, derived from the term "NOT OR." In a NOR gate, the output is true (1) only when none of the inputs are true (0). It's effectively the negation of the OR operation, which returns true when at least one input is true.
    </li>
</ul>

    Now, let's combine these two components to understand the term "XNOR." The XNOR operation is also known as equivalence in Boolean algebra. It returns true if both inputs are the same (both true or both false), which is the opposite of XOR, where true is returned when inputs are different. The name "XNOR" is a concise way of denoting this logical operation, emphasizing its connection to XOR (exclusive OR) and NOR (NOT OR).
